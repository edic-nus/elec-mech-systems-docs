It's time for us to flesh out our bot! 

As you may have guessed, "power" and "signal" aren't actual terms. To increase the usefullness of our diagrams, we are going to need to add more details to them, such as: 

- specific voltages 
- communication protocols used 
- voltage down (or up) stepping 
- battery specification 

We will also explore an alternative way to structure our bots program, through a Real-Time Operating System!
