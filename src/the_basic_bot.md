We will be designing an imaginary robot throughout this book, coined "Basic Bot". The bot has the following design goals: 
- Move forward, backwards, left and right 
- Detect the presence of objects in front of it 
- Move based on detected objects 

There are many ways we can accomplish this task. In an effort to keep things simple, we will be going through a 4 wheeled robot, with 2 of its wheels driven. It will also have an ultrasonic sensor attached to it's front for presence detection. 

Before you proceed to the [next section](./breakdown.md), sketch out or imagine how a robot like this would look like.
