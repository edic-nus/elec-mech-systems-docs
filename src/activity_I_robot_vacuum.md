# Goal 
Design a robot vacuum cleaner which is capable of sucking up debris from the floor! 

# Design contraints 
These design goals must be met: 
- able to suck up debris from the corners of a room 
- know when it is not on the ground 
- avoid falling down stairs or ledges

You do not have to consider: 
- the charging of the robot 
- how it will return to it's charging dock 

# Deliverables
1. Create a system diagram to map out all of your robots electrical components.
2. Create a separate list to list out the considerations which need to be made for each electrical and mechanical component chosen. For example if a motor is used, how will the motor be mounted? 
3. Create a flow diagram to descirbe how your robot's code will function. 

Design your diagrams to act as a reference for yourself in the future. It only has to be as verbose as the content before Activity I. However, you will not be discouraged from making a more detailed diagram from your own knowledge and Google, as long as you are able to answer questions related to your diagram.
