# Goal 
Design a 1 Degree of Freedom (DOF) gimbal capable of holding a 500 g weight. The gimbal needs to be controlled by two buttons, rotating it clockwise and anti-clockwise.

# Design constraints 
The gimbal should prevent the weight from rotating along the y-axis, where the x-axis is into the screen, y-axis is along the screen and the z-axis is upwards. In order words, the gimbal will prevent pitch rotation.

# Deliverables 
1. Create a system architecure for this design, complete with labelled power and signal lines. 
2. Reasoning on how your design works in 2-3 sentences. 
3. Relative thickness of wires used for each power and signal group (from thickest to thinness).
