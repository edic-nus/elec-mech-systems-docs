# Goal 
Design a 2 Degree of Freedom (DOF) gimbal capable of holding a 500 g weight. The gimbal needs to be controlled by via a joystick. 

# Design constraints 
Assumption: 
- x-axis into the screen
- y-axis along the screen 
- z-axis is upwards 

Design a gimbal which is capable of rotating along the XY plane (yaw) and XZ plane (pitch).

# Deliverables 
1. Create a system architecure for this design, complete with labelled power and signal lines. Relative thickness of wires used for each power and signal group (from thickest to thinness, AWG rating not needed) should also be shown on your diagram. 
2. A sketch showing up the components will be mechanically mounted. CAD software can be used if you are familiar with it. 
3. Draw a state diagram or flow chart. Be detailed, but concise. The goal of this diagram is to walk someone through **how** your design works, **not implementation details**.
