# Choosing a battery 
The following steps are general guideline on how to choose a battery in a system (if needed): 
1. Find the minimum and maximum voltage level.
2. Find the maximum current draw and mean current draw.
3. Specify how much space is available for the battery.
4. Specify the operation time of the system. 
5. Specify the weight limits of the system. 
6. Specify if the battery needs to be rechargeable. 

From the above points, [battery type](https://components101.com/articles/different-types-of-batteries-and-their-uses) and specification can be deduced. 

# Batteries can go boom 
The leads of a battery should **NEVER** be short-circuited together. Depending on the current discharge capabilities of the battery, this could lead to [disastarous consequences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsUppV-0QTU).

In addition to this, the following rules should also be followed: 
1. Do not stab batteries. 
2. Do not drop batteries from high places. 
3. Do not throw batteries. 
4. Do not leave batteries unattended while charging (that includes charging overnight!). 
5. Do not heat up batteries or charge them on a surface where heat can build up (a bed). 
6. Do not over-discharge batteries past their capacity limit, such as by leaving the battery connected to the system while it continously drains it. 
7. Do not over-charge batteries while charging, either measure the battery voltage periodically or use a battery charger which automatically stops charging when the desired capacity is reached. 
8. If batteries show signs of bloating or damage, they should **NOT** be used. Dispose of them as soon as possible. 
9. Certain batteries, such as Lithium Polymer batteries, should not be stored while on full-charge as it can damage them. 

> Although this list tries to be exhaustive, it should be not be used as a rulebook. It is good practice to research how to care and use the battery in your possession safely.
