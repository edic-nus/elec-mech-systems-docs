# RoboMasters University Championship
In RMUC, teams develop 7 different types of robots with various functions to face off on the battlefield. Each team's participants will control their robots to attack the enemy's robots and Base by launching projectiles. At the end of the match, the team with the highest remaining Base HP wins.

# RoboMasters University League 
RMUL consists of 2 events - 3V3 and the 1v1 Standard Confrontation. 

In the 3V3 Match, teams develop their own Standard, Hero, and an autonomous Sentry Robot and pilot their robots to launch projectiles against opponent robots and bases. The winner of the match is the team with the higher remaining Base HP. Participating teams can advance to the RoboMaster University Championship (RMUC) through the Scoring and Ranking System.

In the 1V1 Standard Match, teams independently develop their own Standard Robot and pilot their robots to launch projectiles at each other. The winner at the end of the Match shall be the team with the higher remaining Standard Robot HP.

# Rules, rules, rules 
To participate in the RoboMasters competition, team's are required to build a fleet of robot **with** the constraints set out in the rules manuals. 

There are 3 different manuals: 
- Rules Manual 
- Robot Building Specifications Manual
- Participant Manual 

Both RMUC and RMUL have their own Rules and Participant manuals, but share the same Robot Building Specification. All the manuals can be found online (or in NUS RM's [Discord](https://discord.gg/3AbSP8c7)!). 
Before designing a full robot, engineers should AT LEAST read the rules manual pages relevant to the robot you are designing, as well as the specification manual. 

> Although most of the rules manual is not directly related to robots, it is very important as it will outline the importance of the different features on the robot as well as its overall role in the entire competition. 

Understand the rules well, and all other design goals will fall in place.
