As shown in the example system, the devices in your system can function at varying voltage levels. When designing a system, care should be taken to note down the different voltages present and highlight areas where voltage step-up or step-down is needed. 

## Stepping voltage up or down 
Buck converters can be used to step-down voltage while boost converters can be used to step-up voltage. 

Linear regulators can are also capable of stepping-down voltage, but they are more inefficient than buck converters due to how they function. However, they are incredible easy to use due to only having 3 pins: voltage in, ground, and voltage out. 

LDO(low-dropout) regulators, a type of linear regulator, has the special function of maintaining the output voltage even when the input voltage is very close to the output voltage. This characteristic of LDOs make it desirable in certain circuits.
