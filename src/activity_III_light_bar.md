# Goal 
Explain how the light indicator module will be installed on a robot chassis.

# Design constraints 
- As set out in the specification manual. (Read the rules!) 
- Build off a mecanum-wheeled robot with a 360 degree firing mechanism on a gimbal. 

# Deliverables 
Sketch of your design with the location of the light indicator module. 

The sketch should have: 
- all relevant dimensions to understand where the lightbar will be mounted 
- any assumptions made about the underlying design
